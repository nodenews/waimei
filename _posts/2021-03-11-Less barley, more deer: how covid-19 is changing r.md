Some of the fields will be a duller shade of green than they were last year. Stand quietly, and you might spot more large mammals moving through the landscape. Other changes are invisible, being underground or underwater. A year after covid-19 struck Britain, it is affecting the countryside in all sorts of strange ways.</p><p >On-and-off lockdowns mean that Britons are eating less than they used to in sandwich shops, restaurants, pubs and canteens, and more at home. When they do that, they consume more of some things and less of others, even if the number of calories they take in stays about the same. That, in turn, affects what farmers grow, and the countryside.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The changing shade of green reflects a change in cereal crops, caused partly by altered drinking habits. People swallow less beer and more wine when pubs are closed—overall beer consumption fell by about 15% between 2019 and 2020, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. That has suppressed demand not just for hops but also for barley, Britain’s second most important crop by land area.</p><p >Growing barley for malting is tricky at the best of times. Brewers are picky about levels of nitrogen; get it wrong and your crop is good only for animal feed. Teddy Maufe, a farmer and brewer in Norfolk, says that many growers switch between barley and wheat depending on prevailing prices. This year more are sowing wheat. The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (<small>AHDB</small>) estimates that barley will be planted on 1.15m hectares this year, down from 1.39m hectares last year.</p><p >Fewer chips are being eaten, as a result of the closure of pubs, restaurants and many takeaways. Alice Bailey, an analyst at the <small>AHDB</small>, expects some growers to move out of chipping potatoes this year and into Maris Pipers—a variety often sold in supermarkets. Egg sales are roughly flat, but Britons are buying fewer cooked ones (which are often laid by caged hens) and more raw ones off supermarket shelves (which are usually free-range). That change has boosted the farm-gate price of free-range eggs from 80p to 90p per dozen over the past year, enticing so many farmers into the business that the British Free Range Egg Producers Association is now concerned about over-production.</p><p >A bigger change could be caused by falling demand for a rare meat. Venison is usually eaten in restaurants, and their closure has lowered the value of deer carcasses. Fewer are being shot as a result. The National Game Dealers Association says that the number of carcasses being sold is running at about 60% of normal levels.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Deer were multiplying anyway, partly because more trees are being planted. There are probably more of them in Britain now than at any time in the last thousand years, says Charles Smith-Jones, an adviser to the British Deer Society. With fewer culled over the winter, their numbers could jump this year. Deer munch shrubs and young trees, making woods more open. When they thrive, some creatures (like dung beetles) benefit, while others (like ground-nesting birds) suffer.</p><p >The waters around Britain are changing, too. In 2020 British fishing vessels landed 25% fewer crabs and 32% fewer langoustines than the year before, as demand weakened domestically and beyond. Daniel Whittle of Whitby Seafoods, a large scampi processor, says that some langoustine fishermen are likely to leave the trade; there is plenty of work guarding offshore wind-farms these days. Crabs, in particular, could do with a respite. They have been heavily fished in the past few years, partly because of rising demand from China.</p><p >These changes in eating and drinking patterns have created some strange opportunities. Oddbox, a company that sells unwanted fruit and vegetables directly to households (unwanted because they are not pretty enough for supermarkets, or because there is a glut) has been busy in the pandemic. Last year it “rescued” 18 tonnes of salad leaves from one grower who normally supplies restaurants. Some venison is even being given away to food banks. Britain’s neediest people are eating its poshest food.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p ><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus">coronavirus hub</a>.
